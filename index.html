        <p>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda, widely known as José Rizal (Spanish pronunciation: [xoˈse
          riˈsal]; June 19, 1861 – December 30, 1896), was a Filipino nationalist and polymath during the tail end of
          the
          Spanish colonial period of
          the Philippines. An ophthalmologist by profession, Rizal became a writer and a key member of the Filipino
          Propaganda Movement which advocated political reforms for the colony under Spain.</p>

        <p>He was executed by the Spanish colonial government for the crime of rebellion after the Philippine
          Revolution,
          inspired in part by his writings, broke out. Though he was not actively involved in its planning or conduct,
          he
          ultimately approved of its goals which eventually led to Philippine independence.</p>
